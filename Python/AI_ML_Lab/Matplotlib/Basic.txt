# Matplotlib
Matplotlib is a fundamental plotting library in Python used for creating 
static, interactive, and animated visualizations. It provides full control 
over plots (lines, markers, colors, axes, etc.) and is highly customizable.  

Advantages:  
- Very flexible, supports a wide range of plots.  
- Fine-grained control over every plot element.  
- Works well with NumPy and Pandas.  
- Widely used and well-documented.  

Disadvantages:  
- Syntax can be verbose for simple plots.  
- Styling requires more manual work.  
- Default aesthetics are plain compared to modern libraries.  

# Seaborn
Seaborn is a statistical data visualization library built on top of Matplotlib.  
It provides high-level functions for attractive and informative statistical graphics.  
Seaborn focuses on simplicity and better default styling, especially with Pandas DataFrames.  

Advantages:  
- Beautiful default styles with minimal code.  
- Built-in support for statistical plots (box, violin, heatmap, etc.).  
- Works seamlessly with Pandas DataFrames.  
- Great for quick exploratory data analysis (EDA).  

Disadvantages:  
- Less flexible than Matplotlib for custom plots.  
- Depends on Matplotlib, so advanced customization may still require Matplotlib commands.  
- Slightly slower for very large datasets.
